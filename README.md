# Analysis-of-nanopore-epigenetic-sequencing

These scripts and notebooks contain code used in the analysis of nanopore sequence data for the publication: Direct detection of 3-phase cytosine modification states in nanopore sequencing. 

Data produced for these analyses has not yet been made publicly available. 

Public data used in this analysis pertains to the oxBS-seq and TAB-seq data produced in Ma _et al._ (2017). This was downloaded from the Beijing Genome Sequence Archive (GSA), where it is stored under the experimental accession numbers: CRR008807 (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA000145/CRR008807) and CRR008808 (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA000145/CRR008808).
