# Analysis-of-nanopore-epigenetic-sequencing

These scripts and notebooks contain code used in the analysis of nanopore sequence data for the publication: Double and single stranded detection of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine with nanopore sequencing (_in press_). 

New nanopore sequence data in aligned bam format (mm39) has been made available on the NCBI SRA under the BioProject: PRJNA1144670. 

Public data used in this analysis pertains to the oxBS-seq and TAB-seq data produced in Ma _et al._ (2017). This was downloaded from the Beijing Genome Sequence Archive (GSA), where it is stored under the experimental accession numbers: CRX008031 (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA000145/CRR008807) and CRX008030 (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA000145/CRR008808).
